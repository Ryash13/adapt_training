ATLANTA POPULATION

1)	use db.zipcodes.find() to filter results to only the results where city is ATLANTA and state is GA
->	db.zipcodes.find(
    {$and: [ {“city”: “ATLANTA”} , {“state”:”GA”}]
    }).pretty()
 
2)	use db.zipcodes.aggregate with $match to do the same as above.
->	db.zipcodes.aggregate(
    [{$match: {$and: [{“city”: ”ATLANTA”} ,
    {“state”:”GA”}]
    }}]).pretty()


3)	use $group to count the number of zip codes in ATLANTA.
->	db.zipcodes.aggregate(
    {$group: {“_id”: {“city”: “ATLANTA”, “state”: “$state”},
    zips: {$sum: 1}
    }}).pretty()

4)	use $group to find the total population in ATLANTA
->	db.zipcodes.aggregate(
    {$group: {“_id: {“city”: “ATLANTA”},
    {“population”: {$sum: ‘$pop’}}
    }).pretty()



POPULATIONS BY STATE

1)	use aggregate to calculate the total population for each state
->	db.zipcodes.aggregate(
    {$group: {_id:”$state”,
    population: {$sum: “$pop”}}
    }).pretty()

2)	sort the results by population, highest first
->	db.zipcodes.aggregate(
    {$group: {_id: {state:”$state”},
    population :{$sum: “$pop”}}},
    {$sort: {population: -1}}).pretty()

3)	limit the results to just the first 3 results. What are the top 3 states in population?
->	db.zipcodes.aggregate(
    {$group: {_id: {state: “state”},
    population: {$sum:’$pop’}}},
    {$sort: {population: -1}},
    {$limit: 3}).pretty()
    
    

POPULATION BY CITIES
1)	Use aggregate to calculate the total population for each city (you have to use city/state combination). You can use a combination for the _id of the group: {city:’$city’ , state:’$state’}.
->	db.zipcodes.aggregate(
    {$group: {_id: {city:”$city”, state:”$state”},
    population: {$sum:”$pop”}}}).pretty()

2)	sort the results by population, highest first
->	db.zipcodes.aggregate(
    {$group: {_id: {city:”$city”, state:”$state”},
    population: {$sum: ‘$pop’}}},
    {$sort: {population: -1}}).pretty()

3)	limit the results to just the first 3 results. What are the top 3 states in population?
->	db.zipcodes.aggregate(
    {$group: {_id: {city:”$city”, state:”$state”},
    population: {$sum: ‘$pop’}}},
    {$sort: {population: -1}},
    {$limit:3}).pretty()

4)	What are the top 3 cities in population in Texas.
-> db.zipcodes.aggregate(
    {$group: { _id: {city:”$city” , state:’Texas’},
    population: {$sum: ‘$pop’}}},
    {$sort: {population: -1}},
    {$limit: 3}).pretty()



BONUS
1)	Write a query to get the average city population for each state.
->	db.zipcodes.aggregate([ 
    {$group: {_id: {state:'$state',city:'$city'},pop:{$sum: '$pop'}}}, 
    {$group: {_id: "$_id.state",AverageStatepopulation:{$avg:"$pop"}}}
    ]).pretty()

2)	What are the top 3 states in terms of average city population?
->	db.zipcodes.aggregate([ 
    {$group: {_id: {state:'$state',city:'$city'},pop:{$sum: '$pop'}}}, 
    {$group: {_id: "$_id.city",AverageCityPopulation:{$avg:"$pop"}}},
    {$sort:{AverageCityPopulation: -1}},
    {$limit: 3} ]).pretty()
